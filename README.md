## Project Description

This project is in early stages, the idea is to:

* Create an Arduino based motorcycle electronic unit for controlling electrical components for 'classic' (=older) motorcycles
  * The project do not aim to replace or modify the motorcycle engine ignition system
  * This system will typically "start" after the generator/alternator and rectifier/regulator on the motorcyle has done it's job
* Provide software and instructions free of charge
* Create a community for motorcycle- and Arduino enthusiasts that want to contribute
* Make the solution universal and configurable, it should be suitable for as many motorcycle brands and models as possible

Long term goals, depending on the success of the project:
* Provide a DIY kit with all parts needed
* Provide a completely built solution ready to be installed on the bike

Some of the benefits the system (hopefully) will give:

* Reliability: Individial solid state relays with inbuilt automatic fuses controls 12V to the bikes electrical components
* Simplify wiring: Single cable per component, separat wiring for input controls on handlebar and output power to components
* Providing customization: Setting parameters to enable features and how they should work
* Gives posibility to improve or add new features to the motorcycle (optional): 
  * Touch buttons instead of traditional handlebar switches
  * Keyless ignition using bluetooth, RF-ID or "password" using input buttons
  * OLED display instead of traditional speedometer, tachometer and warning lights
  * Smart functions, ex: auto turn off indicator lights, not possible to trigger start motor when engine is running
  * Alarm if bike is moved
* Use standard components compatible with Arduino / ESP32 chip
* Provide a budget friendly solution as an alternative to expensive commercial products

## Dev environment info

The software is developed using Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO
The programming language is C++
